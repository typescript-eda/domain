* Overview

This repository contains the core domain primitives for the TypeScript-EDA event-driven architecture framework. It provides the foundational building blocks: Entity, Event, and ValueObject base classes.

* Repository History

** Monorepo Separation (2024-01-07)

This repository was extracted from the original chatgpt-buddy monorepo as part of Phase 8A of the Semantest platform evolution. The separation preserves the complete git history of the typescript-eda-domain directory.

*** Key Changes
- Extracted from =typescript-eda-domain/= directory in the monorepo
- Now published as =@typescript-eda/domain= on npm
- Repository URL: https://github.com/typescript-eda/domain
- Part of the typescript-eda organization

*** Post-Separation Setup Required
1. Update package.json dependencies from workspace references to npm packages
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
3. Configure npm publishing with NPM_TOKEN secret
4. Update README with proper documentation

** Original Development

The domain package was initially developed as part of the chatgpt-buddy project to provide a solid foundation for event-driven architecture in TypeScript. It implements Domain-Driven Design principles with:

- Base =Entity= class with identity management
- Base =Event= class for domain events
- Base =ValueObject= class for immutable values
- TypeScript decorators for metadata
- Strong typing throughout

* Technical Architecture

** Core Classes

*** Entity
Base class for all domain entities with:
- Unique identifier management
- Equality comparison based on ID
- Lifecycle hooks
- Event emission capabilities

*** Event
Base class for domain events with:
- Event type identification
- Timestamp tracking
- Aggregate ID reference
- Event versioning support

*** ValueObject
Base class for value objects with:
- Immutability enforcement
- Structural equality comparison
- Validation hooks
- Serialization support

* Future Roadmap

- Add event sourcing utilities
- Implement aggregate root base class
- Add domain service patterns
- Create testing utilities
- Improve documentation and examples
