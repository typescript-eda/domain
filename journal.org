#+TITLE: TypeScript-EDA Domain - Development Journal
#+AUTHOR: TypeScript-EDA Team
#+DATE: [2024-01-07]

* Overview

This repository contains the core domain primitives for the TypeScript-EDA event-driven architecture framework. It provides the foundational building blocks: Entity, Event, and ValueObject base classes.

* Repository History

** Monorepo Separation (2024-01-07)

This repository was extracted from the original chatgpt-buddy monorepo as part of Phase 8A of the Semantest platform evolution. The separation preserves the complete git history of the typescript-eda-domain directory.

*** Key Changes
- Extracted from =typescript-eda-domain/= directory in the monorepo
- Now published as =@typescript-eda/domain= on npm
- Repository URL: https://github.com/typescript-eda/domain
- Part of the typescript-eda organization

*** Post-Separation Setup Required
1. Update package.json dependencies from workspace references to npm packages
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
3. Configure npm publishing with NPM_TOKEN secret
4. Update README with proper documentation

** Package Configuration Updates (2025-01-07)

As part of the post-monorepo-separation tasks, the package.json was updated to reflect the new organizational structure:

*** Changes Made
- Updated package name to =@typescript-eda/domain= (using the typescript-eda npm organization)
- Updated repository URLs to point to =https://github.com/typescript-eda/domain=
- Updated bugs URL to =https://github.com/typescript-eda/domain/issues=
- Updated homepage to =https://github.com/typescript-eda/domain=
- All dependencies remain as npm packages (no workspace references)
- Added proper author attribution to "TypeScript-EDA Team"

*** Rationale
These changes complete the transition from the monorepo structure to independent repositories under the typescript-eda GitHub organization. The package is now ready to be published to npm as a standalone module that other TypeScript-EDA packages can depend on.

** Original Development

The domain package was initially developed as part of the chatgpt-buddy project to provide a solid foundation for event-driven architecture in TypeScript. It implements Domain-Driven Design principles with:

- Base =Entity= class with identity management
- Base =Event= class for domain events
- Base =ValueObject= class for immutable values
- TypeScript decorators for metadata
- Strong typing throughout

* Technical Architecture

** Core Classes

*** Entity
Base class for all domain entities with:
- Unique identifier management
- Equality comparison based on ID
- Lifecycle hooks
- Event emission capabilities

*** Event
Base class for domain events with:
- Event type identification
- Timestamp tracking
- Aggregate ID reference
- Event versioning support

*** ValueObject
Base class for value objects with:
- Immutability enforcement
- Structural equality comparison
- Validation hooks
- Serialization support

* Future Roadmap

- Add event sourcing utilities
- Implement aggregate root base class
- Add domain service patterns
- Create testing utilities
- Improve documentation and examples

* Phase 9: Security Architecture Foundation (2025-07-14 to 2025-07-15)

** Overview
Phase 9 established security patterns at the domain level, ensuring that all TypeScript-EDA based applications inherit security best practices from the foundation.

** Security Enhancements
*** Secure Entity Design
- Added validation hooks for entity creation
- Immutable ID generation with cryptographic randomness
- Audit trail support in base entity
- Protected state modification patterns

*** Event Security
- Event integrity through correlation IDs
- Timestamp validation and tamper detection
- Event source authentication metadata
- Secure event serialization

*** Value Object Protection
- Input validation enforcement
- Safe equality comparison
- Sanitization in toString methods
- Protection against injection attacks

** Implementation Patterns
*** Secure Entity Base
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
// Enhanced Entity with security features
export abstract class Entity<T> {
  protected readonly _id: string;
  protected readonly _createdAt: Date;
  protected readonly _createdBy?: string;
  
  protected constructor(props: T, id?: string) {
    this._id = id || this.generateSecureId();
    this._createdAt = new Date();
    this.validate(props);
  }
  
  private generateSecureId(): string {
    // Cryptographically secure ID generation
    return crypto.randomUUID();
  }
  
  protected abstract validate(props: T): void;
}
#+END_SRC

*** Secure Event Pattern
- Correlation ID for request tracking
- Immutable event properties
- Metadata for security context
- Audit trail integration

** Domain Security Patterns
*** Input Validation
- Required validation in all value objects
- Type-safe validation methods
- Domain-specific constraints
- Clear validation errors

*** Data Protection
- No sensitive data in toString
- Safe serialization methods
- Memory cleanup for sensitive data
- Encryption hooks for storage

** Testing Security
*** Security Test Patterns
- Validation boundary testing
- Injection attack prevention
- Serialization safety
- Event integrity verification

*** Test Coverage
- 100% coverage of security paths
- Edge case validation
- Error handling verification
- Performance impact measurement

** Documentation Updates
*** Security Guidelines
- Entity creation best practices
- Event security patterns
- Value object validation
- Common security pitfalls

*** Implementation Examples
- Secure user entity
- Authenticated event pattern
- Validated email value object
- Audit trail implementation
